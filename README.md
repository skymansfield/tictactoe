User Story

1. The browser tab needs to match the game title

2. The game needs the traditional 3x3 grid

3. The entire grid will be clickable

4. The grid cells will have the correct player symbol ( X or O ) displayed

5. The UI will display a message indicating which user's turn it is

6. When the game ends it should display who won the game or if the game ended in a draw

7. There will be a restart game button that will restart the entire game

## <em>Hints for your JavaScript:
   ### <em>Your game should: 
- <em>track clicks that occur on the cells
- <em>check if a valid move has been made
- <em>prevent cells from being selected more than once
- <em>keep track of and validate game status
- <em>THEN change the active player

- <em>check if there is a winner or if there is a draw
- <em>stop the game once there is a win or draw
- <em>udpate the UI to reflect all of the above

## Note
- Once the app is fully functional, feel free to give it your own style
